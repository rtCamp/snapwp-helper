   - Affected source files (include full paths or URLs if possible)
   - The version or commit where the issue was found

4. **Resolution and Disclosure:**
   We will work to either resolve the vulnerability or provide mitigation steps. Once a fix is published or the issue is otherwise addressed, we will inform you. You may then publicly disclose the vulnerability after receiving our confirmation.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability** publicly until the fix is released or we have given you the go-ahead.

5. **Credit:**
   If you are the first to report the issue and you request recognition, we will credit you in the security advisory.
